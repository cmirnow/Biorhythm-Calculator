## Biorhythm Calculator on Ruby

Oops ... I did it on Sinatra. But it seems that the [Rails](https://masterpro.herokuapp.com/bio/index) were better. :)

How to start:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmirnow/Biorhythm-Calculator.git
cd Biorhythm-Calculator
bundle install
bundle exec shotgun
```
...and go to http://localhost:9393
